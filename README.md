# Chatwa

Jamaican Patois, known locally as Patois (Patwa or Patwah) and called Jamaican Creole by linguists, is an English-based creole language with West African influences (a majority of loan words of Akan origin) spoken primarily in Jamaica and the Jamaican diaspora.

Chatwa is word guessing game based on Jamaican Patois. The main user interface presents the User with a hint in standard english and a grid of letters to choose from for the user to guess the answer. The app uses the [Jamaican Patty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaican_patty), a pastry popular in Jamaica, as a form of In-App currency for users to use to get hints for the answer. The user can use a number of patties in exchange for a letter in the answer and the user can also use the share icon in the navigation bar to share a screenshot with their friends asking for help.
