# Chatwa-Swift3
Simple iOS Patois guessing game for my Udacity Nanodegree Final Project :)

# What's completed

# What's left to be done
* Switching rounds
* UI polishing
* Social media sharing
* Saving game state when users asks for a letter in the answer
* In-app purchases(Maybe?)
* Game center Integrartion(Maybe?)
